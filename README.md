### Parallel Execution Benefits
- **2-3x faster delivery** through concurrent agent work
- **Efficient resource utilization** across specialist agents
- **Reduced bottlenecks** from sequential dependencies
- **Better coordination** through clear interface contracts

## 🔄 Agent Coordination Patterns

### 🎯 Recommended Workflow for Complex Projects
For optimal results, follow this sequence for project-level requests:

```
User Request → prd-writer → project-manager → architect → implementation agents → testing → deployment
```

**Key Benefits**:
- **prd-writer** ensures clear requirements before development starts
- **project-manager** coordinates multi-agent workflows efficiently  
- **architect** designs from well-defined requirements
- Implementation agents work from solid technical foundations

### Alternative Patterns

#### Quick Fix Workflow
```
User Request → debugger/refactorer → language expert → test-automator
```

#### Infrastructure Workflow
```
User Request → cloud-architect → kubernetes-expert → devops-engineer → monitoring-expert
```

#### Parallel Execution
```
User Request → [Frontend Agent + Backend Agent + Database Agent] → Integration
```

#### Conditional Routing
```
Error Detected → Debugger → (Python Expert | JS Expert | Go Expert) → Fix
```

#### Growth Marketing Workflow
```
User Request → growth-hacker → [content-strategist + seo-expert] → copywriter → analytics
```

#### API Modernization Workflow
```
User Request → architect → [graphql-expert | grpc-expert] → implementation → api-documenter
```

#### Customer Success Workflow
```
New Customer → customer-success-manager → onboarding → training → growth opportunities
```

#### Compliance Workflow
```
Regulatory Change → legal-compliance-expert → [security-auditor + developers] → implementation
```

See [WORKFLOW_CONFIG.md](WORKFLOW_CONFIG.md) for detailed workflow patterns and routing rules.

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Agents
1. Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category
2. Follow the agent template format:
```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: When this agent should be invoked
tools: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3
---

Agent system prompt and expertise...
```

### Modifying Existing Agents
- Edit the agent's markdown file
- Update the description for better routing
- Add or remove tools as needed
- Enhance the system prompt with new capabilities

## 📊 Best Practices

1. **Start with prd-writer for complex projects** - Define requirements before jumping into implementation
2. **Let project-manager coordinate** - Use the orchestrator for multi-agent workflows
3. **Provide context** - Include tech stack, constraints, and requirements
4. **Use explicit invocation** when you need specific expertise
5. **Follow the recommended workflow** - prd-writer → project-manager → architect → implementation
6. **Review agent suggestions** - Specialists may have different priorities
